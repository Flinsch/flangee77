     * A single quadratic Bézier curve consists of three points (you don't say): an
     * on-curve start point, an off-curve control point, and an on-curve end point;
     * with each of two consecutive curves sharing one on-curve point. The first and
     * last Bézier curves also share an on-curve point to close the contour. The
     * shared points are not stored twice, except for the shared point of the first
     * and last Bézier curves, which is stored identically twice, as the very first
     * and very last point. On-curve and off-curve points thus alternate, and the
     * total number of points is always odd, while the number of resulting Bézier
     * curves is (n - 1) / 2, where n is the number of points.
     *
     * If the points are arranged clockwise, the contour is filled. If the points
     * are arranged counter-clockwise, they describe a "hole".
