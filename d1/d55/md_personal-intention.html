<div class="textblock"><p><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a> Since I was a young teenager, I've always wanted to be a video game developer. Unfortunately, I never managed to turn that into a career. However, maybe that's for the best, because I think the day-to-day of video game development, with its economic pressures, can be pretty tough. What I have managed to do, though, is become a professional software developer in general. Video game development has since remained one of my hobbies. And since it's not a professional thing, it stays a hobby&mdash;one that I can enjoy with all the facets that interest me, and without the aspects that I don't feel like doing anyway.</p>
<p>Since it's a hobby, for me, the journey is the goal, not the finished product. Others might feel differently, but that's how I see it. That's also why I don't use off-the-shelf frameworks or even full-fledged engines; I prefer to program &ldquo;everything&rdquo; myself. I'm primarily interested in the technical, low-level stuff anyway, so I usually keep experimenting with tricky things as prototypes rather than actually releasing a finished product. And at the end of the day, I'm a programmer, not a game designer&mdash;a realization I've come to more than once.</p>
<p>Added to this is a mix of curiosity, stubbornness, and the sheer joy of solving problems in unconventional ways. While most developers might choose polished, off-the-shelf, battle-tested tools, this framework stands apart as a deeply personal experiment: a modular, multi-faceted toolset for creating (prototypical aspects of) games in ways you might not expect.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
The Journey of (Re)building My Framework</h1>
<p>It must have been around 2005 when I laid the foundation for this framework. Well, that's not entirely accurate. It was actually a predecessor of this framework that I (further) developed and used for about 18 years. Up until then, I had exclusively targeted DirectX with Direct3D 9 on Windows, limited to 32-bit. But in the middle of 2023, I suddenly decided to rewrite my framework from scratch because I was running into issues with the existing 32-bit implementation based on Direct3D 9 under Windows 11.</p>
<p>It would probably have been enough to abandon the DirectX SDK (June 2010) and switch to the long-recommended Windows SDK, which would have meant more than just replacing a few includes and libraries, and perhaps optionally switching from 32-bit to 64-bit. Well, in the end, I did make the switch&mdash;both of those changes&mdash;but with the far more consequential decision to rebuild &ldquo;everything&rdquo; from the ground up (well, I still reuse a lot of things, of course). This time, I aimed to generalize the framework so it wouldn't be limited to a single technology stack but could potentially support multiple ones (e.g., Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 11, and maybe later OpenGL or others, and generally not just DirectX components).</p>
<p>This, of course, requires an additional abstraction layer, as the technologies offer different interfaces while the application is meant to offer a uniform &ldquo;facade.&rdquo; And who knows? Perhaps I'll even target platforms other than Windows. We'll see. But smartphones, and especially consoles, are probably off the table&mdash;that wouldn't make much sense, in my opinion, even despite (or perhaps because of) my personal background I've just described. </p>
