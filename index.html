<p><em>An unlikely modular game framework</em></p>
<hr  />
<p>This framework is so unlikely that it probably shouldn't exist. At least <em>you</em> probably shouldn't use it at all! I mean, you <em>can</em> use it, of course. It's here, under the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT license</a>. So go ahead! But you would certainly be better off using other frameworks or even game engines, whether they are quadruple-A tier or free to use.</p>
<p>Before we go further, let's get something straight: this isn't a game engine. If an engine is like a full-course meal&mdash;prepared, plated, and ready to serve&mdash;this framework is more like a set of some ingredients and a recipe book (a recipe book that is missing a few pages). An engine offers everything you need, often at the cost of flexibility, as you're bound by its design and philosophy. For most developers, that's perfectly fine: engines are powerful, polished, and cater to almost any need you'll ever have, at least indirectly via possible workarounds, if not directly.</p>
<p>A framework, on the other hand, offers more freedom, but also requires more responsibility. It's a structured set of tools that you can use, but you'll still need to roll up your sleeves and cook up your own solutions. You're free to stay within the &ldquo;frame&rdquo; or step outside it when you need to, but there's no hand-holding or guarantees that everything you'll want is already there.</p>
<p>(To clear up any misunderstandings of a tired reader: enjoying the meal in the metaphor above means making a game, not playing it.)</p>
<p>Think of it this way: if engines are for those who want everything ready to go, and libraries are for those who want to piece everything together from scratch, a framework sits comfortably in the middle. It gives you tools, structure, and flexibility, but the rest is up to you.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, but what exactly is all this about, you ask? Haha, good question! I'll try to give a somewhat comprehensible answer to that, see my <a class="el" href="d7/ddb/md__2home_2runner_2work_2flangee77_2flangee77_2docs_2personal-intention.html">Personal Background and Intention</a>.</p>
<p>And to answer the question of who might use this framework now, I will try to make a case distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you a <b>professional</b> video game developer? Then you should definitely not use this framework and instead go for something really professional: robust, industry-standard tools that are tested, maintained, and supported by large teams, an off-the-shelf engine, or an in-house engine from your company. Compared to those, this framework is like an oddball: unlikely to fit into your pipelines unless you're unusually adventurous.</li>
<li>Are you an <b>indie</b> video game developer? Then you are likely focused on speed, polish, and tools that &ldquo;just work.&rdquo; You are interested in getting a finished game pretty soon and should use tools that help you with &ldquo;everything&rdquo; and not just an unusual framework where you still have to build a lot of things yourself. <br  />
(Of course, you can still be a professional as an indie developer, that's for sure. Please don't get me wrong here!)</li>
<li>Are you a <b>hobbyist</b> video game developer? Then the question is what your intention is: Do you really want to do game development that will produce a finished product? Then the same answer applies to you as to the indie developer. Or are you like me and prefer to build &ldquo;everything&rdquo; yourself because it's fun and the journey is the goal, not necessarily a finished game, even though that would still be welcome? Well, then the recommendation is not necessarily a full-fledged engine, but still another, mature framework. Or you can do what I did and build your own framework (or even your own engine).</li>
<li>Are you the <b>original author</b> (that's me!)? Then I'm just talking to myself. Let's be honest: This framework was made for my own &ldquo;creative&rdquo; needs, challenges, and ideas. It reflects my journey and priorities (see my <a class="el" href="d7/ddb/md__2home_2runner_2work_2flangee77_2flangee77_2docs_2personal-intention.html">Personal Background and Intention</a> again), and while it may not suit everyone, it's &ldquo;exactly&rdquo; what I wanted to build. (Well, not quite. This may sound familiar to you: when you look at your own code after a few months, you want to throw parts of it out and do it again in a new and better way. So this will never be &ldquo;finished&rdquo; anyway.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I'm not here to start a big discussion about whether and when you should use which framework/engine or even build your own, but you see: there are &ldquo;not many&rdquo; reasons to use <em>this</em> framework. I've probably done a better job of convincing you to <em>not</em> use it than the other way around. But hey, maybe you're thinking, <em>what kind of framework is so unlikely that its own creator argues against using it? I have to try this precisely because of that!</em></p>
<p>In this case, yes: Welcome, my friend!</p>
